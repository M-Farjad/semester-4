what is a Trap Door in terms of OS?
ChatGPT

In the context of operating systems, a "trap door" refers to a hidden or undocumented method of gaining unauthorized access to a system or bypassing its security mechanisms. Also known as a "backdoor," a trap door is typically created by the system's designers or administrators for legitimate purposes such as debugging, maintenance, or emergency access. However, if a trap door is discovered or exploited by unauthorized individuals, it can pose a significant security risk.

Trap doors can be intentionally created during the development of an operating system or installed afterward by malicious actors. They often provide a secret entry point that allows privileged access to the system, enabling an attacker to perform unauthorized actions, such as modifying or extracting sensitive data, executing malicious code, or taking control of the system. Unauthorized trap doors can be challenging to detect since they are hidden and not documented in the system's official documentation.

It is important to note that trap doors are considered security vulnerabilities and are generally not present in well-designed and trusted operating systems. However, in certain cases, they have been discovered in various software systems, leading to security breaches and significant concerns about the integrity and confidentiality of the affected systems. Therefore, maintaining strong security practices, regularly updating software, and employing robust security measures can help mitigate the risks associated with trap doors.

what is Grappling hook in OS?
ChatGPT

In the context of operating systems, a "grappling hook" is not a term commonly used. However, if you are referring to a grappling hook in a more general computing or cybersecurity context, it could have a different meaning.

In computer security, a "grappling hook" may refer to a tool or technique used by hackers or penetration testers to gain unauthorized access to a target system. The term is often associated with advanced exploitation and privilege escalation techniques. It typically involves taking advantage of vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a system to gain a foothold and elevate privileges, allowing the attacker to move deeper into the system and access more sensitive information or perform malicious activities.

A grappling hook can be used to exploit vulnerabilities such as software flaws, misconfigurations, weak user credentials, or insecure network protocols. Once the initial access is gained, the attacker can use various techniques to maintain persistence, expand their control, and potentially gain administrative or root-level access to the compromised system.

It's important to note that the term "grappling hook" is not a standardized or widely recognized term in the field of computer security. However, it may be used metaphorically to describe the process of exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and control over a system.





User
what is Port scanning in os?
ChatGPT

In the context of operating systems and computer networking, port scanning refers to the process of actively probing a target system to determine which network ports are open and accessible. A network port is a specific endpoint through which data is sent and received in network communication.

During a port scan, a scanning tool or software sends network requests to different ports on a target system to check if they are open, closed, or filtered. The scanning tool typically sends various types of network packets, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets, to different port numbers and analyzes the responses received.

The primary purpose of port scanning is to identify open ports, as they indicate potential services or applications running on the target system. By determining which ports are open, an attacker can gather information about the target system's configuration, potential vulnerabilities, and services that may be exploitable.

Port scanning can serve both legitimate and malicious purposes. Legitimate uses include network monitoring, security assessments, and troubleshooting network connectivity issues. However, malicious actors may employ port scanning techniques as part of their reconnaissance process to identify potential targets, vulnerable systems, or entry points for unauthorized access.

It's important to note that indiscriminate or aggressive port scanning can be considered intrusive and may trigger security alerts or countermeasures from network administrators or security systems. Additionally, unauthorized port scanning without proper authorization is illegal and violates ethical guidelines.

Explain RSA algorithm
ChatGPT

The RSA algorithm is a widely used cryptographic algorithm for secure communication, digital signatures, and encryption. It is named after its inventors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first introduced it in 1977.

At its core, RSA relies on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers and the computational difficulty of factoring the product of two primes. The algorithm involves two main operations: key generation and encryption/decryption.

Key Generation:

Select two distinct prime numbers, p and q.
Calculate the modulus, n, by multiplying p and q (n = p * q).
Compute Euler's totient function (φ(n)) as (p-1) * (q-1).
Choose an integer, e, that is relatively prime to φ(n) and less than φ(n). This serves as the public exponent.
Calculate the private exponent, d, using the modular inverse of e modulo φ(n), such that (d * e) mod φ(n) = 1.
The public key is represented by (e, n), and the private key is represented by (d, n).
Encryption:
To encrypt a message (plaintext), represented as M:

Convert the plaintext message into a numeric value, typically using a specific encoding like ASCII or Unicode.
Compute the ciphertext C as C = M^e mod n. Here, e is the public exponent and n is the modulus.
Decryption:
To decrypt the ciphertext (C) and obtain the original message (M):

Apply the decryption formula: M = C^d mod n. Here, d is the private exponent and n is the modulus.
Convert the decrypted numeric value back into the original plaintext message using the appropriate encoding.
The security of the RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. As long as the prime numbers used for key generation are sufficiently large, it is computationally infeasible to derive the private key from the public key, making RSA a secure cryptographic scheme.

RSA is widely used in various applications, such as secure email communication, digital signatures, SSL/TLS encryption for secure web browsing, and secure key exchange protocols.





User
explain RSA cryptography with a simple example
ChatGPT

Certainly! Let's go through a simple example to illustrate how RSA cryptography works.

Step 1: Key Generation

Choose two prime numbers, let's say p = 7 and q = 11.
Calculate the modulus, n, by multiplying p and q: n = 7 * 11 = 77.
Compute Euler's totient function (φ(n)) as (p - 1) * (q - 1) = 6 * 10 = 60.
Select a public exponent, e, which is relatively prime to φ(n) and less than 60. Let's choose e = 13.
Calculate the private exponent, d, such that (d * e) mod φ(n) = 1. In this case, d = 37.
The public key is (e, n) = (13, 77), and the private key is (d, n) = (37, 77).
Step 2: Encryption
Suppose we want to encrypt the message "HELLO". We'll convert each letter into its corresponding ASCII value:
H = 72, E = 69, L = 76, and O = 79.

To encrypt each letter:

Take the ASCII value of the letter and apply the encryption formula: C = M^e mod n.
For "H": C = 72^13 mod 77 = 65.
For "E": C = 69^13 mod 77 = 43.
For "L": C = 76^13 mod 77 = 68.
For "O": C = 79^13 mod 77 = 17.
The resulting ciphertext is "65 43 68 17".

Step 3: Decryption
To decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the original message:

Apply the decryption formula: M = C^d mod n.
For "65": M = 65^37 mod 77 = 72, which corresponds to the ASCII value of "H".
For "43": M = 43^37 mod 77 = 69, which corresponds to the ASCII value of "E".
For "68": M = 68^37 mod 77 = 76, which corresponds to the ASCII value of "L".
For "17": M = 17^37 mod 77 = 79, which corresponds to the ASCII value of "O".
The decrypted message is "HELLO".

This example demonstrates how the message "HELLO" is encrypted using the public key (e, n) and then decrypted using the private key (d, n). The encryption process ensures that only someone possessing the private key can decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the original message, providing confidentiality and security.

Is SRT more “optimal” than SJN in terms of the minimum 
average waiting time for a given set of processes?
ChatGPT

The comparison between the Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) and Shortest Job Next (SJN) scheduling algorithms in terms of minimum average waiting time is not straightforward. Both algorithms have their own advantages and considerations.

SRT (Shortest Remaining Time):
SRT aims to minimize the waiting time by choosing the process with the shortest remaining burst time to execute. It preemptively interrupts the running process if a shorter job arrives. SRT is effective when there is a mix of short and long jobs, and it can achieve optimal average waiting time if the arrival pattern is known in advance. However, SRT requires constantly updating and reevaluating the remaining time of each process, which can introduce overhead and may not be practical in real-time systems.

SJN (Shortest Job Next):
SJN schedules processes based on their total execution time, prioritizing the shortest jobs first. This approach can lead to shorter waiting times for shorter jobs, but it may cause longer waiting times for longer jobs. SJN is not always optimal in terms of average waiting time, as it suffers from the "convoy effect" where longer jobs are delayed by shorter jobs in the queue. Additionally, SJN requires knowing the execution time of each process in advance, which may not always be feasible.

In summary, SRT can potentially achieve a lower average waiting time if the arrival pattern is known, but it comes with overhead due to frequent context switching. SJN, on the other hand, prioritizes short jobs but may result in longer waiting times for longer jobs and relies on accurate knowledge of execution times. The optimality of either algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the workload and the system requirements.

how to calculate d in Rsa formula (d * e) mod φ(n) = 1?
ChatGPT

To calculate the value of "d" in the RSA formula (d * e) mod φ(n) = 1, you can use the modular multiplicative inverse.

Here's a step-by-step process to calculate "d":

Calculate Euler's totient function (φ(n)) using the formula:
φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
where "p" and "q" are the prime factors of the modulus "n".

Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse of "e" modulo φ(n). This algorithm will give you the coefficients "x" and "y" such that:
(e * x) + (φ(n) * y) = gcd(e, φ(n))

If the gcd(e, φ(n)) is not equal to 1, then there is no modular multiplicative inverse for "e" modulo φ(n), and the calculation cannot be performed. In RSA, "e" must be relatively prime to φ(n).

If the gcd(e, φ(n)) is equal to 1, you can obtain the modular multiplicative inverse "d" by taking the coefficient "x" calculated in step 2.

If "x" is a negative value, add φ(n) to it to make it positive:
d = (x + φ(n)) % φ(n)

Now you have calculated the value of "d" that satisfies the equation (d * e) mod φ(n) = 1. This "d" value is the private exponent used in the RSA encryption and decryption process.

is GCD similar to LCM or HCF
ChatGPT

GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple) are related concepts in number theory, but they serve different purposes and are calculated differently.

GCD:
The GCD of two or more numbers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the given numbers without leaving a remainder. It represents the highest common factor shared by those numbers. For example, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6, as 6 is the largest number that divides both 12 and 18 evenly.

LCM:
The LCM of two or more numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without leaving a remainder. It represents the lowest common multiple of those numbers. For example, the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12, as 12 is the smallest number that is divisible by both 4 and 6.

GCD and LCM are related through the following property:
GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b

HCF (Highest Common Factor) is another term used to refer to the GCD. In some regions, particularly in British English, the term HCF is more commonly used instead of GCD. They represent the same concept and are calculated using the same principles.

To calculate GCD and LCM, there are different algorithms available, such as Euclidean algorithm for GCD and prime factorization or using GCD for LCM. These algorithms involve specific steps and computations to find the GCD or LCM of given numbers.

In summary, GCD represents the largest divisor common to multiple numbers, LCM represents the smallest multiple common to multiple numbers, and HCF is an alternative term for GCD. They are distinct concepts but related to each other in number theory.





User
what is the best scheduling algorithm of CPU in terms of waiting time, turnaround time, completion time, response time
ChatGPT

The choice of the best CPU scheduling algorithm depends on the specific characteristics and requirements of the system. Different scheduling algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses. However, some algorithms are commonly considered better than others in terms of waiting time, turnaround time, completion time, and response time.

One such algorithm is the Shortest Job Next (SJN), also known as Shortest Job First (SJF) or Preemptive Shortest Job First (PSJF). SJN aims to minimize the waiting time and completion time by selecting the process with the shortest burst time to execute next. This algorithm gives priority to shorter jobs, allowing them to complete quickly and reduce overall waiting time. However, SJN requires knowledge of the burst times of all processes in advance, which may not always be available or practical.

Another efficient algorithm is the Shortest Remaining Time (SRT), which is a preemptive version of SJN. SRT selects the process with the shortest remaining burst time to execute, allowing for dynamic adaptation as new processes arrive. This algorithm optimizes waiting time and response time by interrupting running processes when shorter jobs arrive. However, SRT involves more context switching and overhead due to frequent preemptions.

In addition to SJN and SRT, other scheduling algorithms such as Round Robin (RR), Priority Scheduling, and Multilevel Queue Scheduling can also have good performance in terms of waiting time, turnaround time, completion time, and response time, depending on the specific scenario and workload.

It's important to note that the "best" scheduling algorithm may vary depending on factors such as the workload characteristics (mix of short and long jobs), system requirements (response time, throughput), and fairness considerations. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the specific context and requirements when selecting a CPU scheduling algorithm.

Chip-multithreading (CMT) 
hyperthreading
ChatGPT

Chip-multithreading (CMT) and hyperthreading are two technologies aimed at improving the performance and efficiency of processors by allowing simultaneous execution of multiple threads on a single core.

Chip-multithreading (CMT):
CMT, also known as simultaneous multithreading (SMT), is a technique used in modern processors to execute multiple threads on a single physical core. CMT technology enables the processor to better utilize its resources by keeping the core busy with instructions from multiple threads. Each thread is assigned a separate set of architectural registers, allowing them to progress independently and overlap their execution. CMT can improve overall performance by exploiting instruction-level parallelism and reducing stalls in the pipeline. Examples of processors utilizing CMT include Sun Microsystems' UltraSPARC T1/T2/T3 processors and Oracle's SPARC M-series processors.

Hyperthreading:
Hyperthreading is Intel's proprietary implementation of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) technology. It allows a single physical core to handle multiple threads simultaneously by duplicating certain parts of the processor's architecture. With hyperthreading, the processor appears as multiple logical processors to the operating system, allowing it to execute multiple threads in parallel. Each logical processor shares the core's resources, such as cache and execution units, but maintains separate architectural state and instruction pipelines. Hyperthreading aims to improve overall processor utilization and performance by reducing idle time and better utilizing available resources. Hyperthreading is commonly found in Intel's processors, including the Core i3, i5, and i7 series.

Both CMT and hyperthreading enhance CPU performance by exploiting thread-level parallelism and utilizing idle resources. However, it's important to note that the extent of performance improvement depends on factors such as the nature of the workload, thread dependencies, and the specific implementation of the technology. Not all workloads can benefit significantly from CMT or hyperthreading, and the performance gain may vary across different applications and scenarios.

Homogeneous processors: Homogeneous processors refer to a system where all the processors are identical and have the same capabilities and architecture.

Asymmetric multiprocessing: Asymmetric multiprocessing is a system configuration where each processor in the system is assigned specific tasks or responsibilities, such as handling specific types of workloads or executing specific functions.

Symmetric multiprocessing: Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) is a system configuration where multiple processors share the same memory and have equal access to system resources, allowing them to work together on tasks in a balanced manner.

Processor affinity: Processor affinity refers to the assignment of a specific process or thread to a particular processor or set of processors in a multiprocessor system, aiming to optimize performance by reducing cache misses and improving locality.

Soft and hard (real-time systems): In the context of real-time systems, soft and hard refer to different levels of time constraints. Soft real-time systems have deadlines that are flexible, and missing a deadline may degrade performance but does not cause catastrophic consequences. Hard real-time systems have strict and non-negotiable deadlines, where missing a deadline can lead to system failure or dangerous situations.





User
soft afinity and hard afinity
ChatGPT

Soft affinity and hard affinity are terms commonly used in the context of processor affinity, which refers to the assignment of processes or threads to specific processors in a multiprocessor system.

Soft affinity: Soft affinity implies a preference or suggestion for a process or thread to execute on a particular processor, but it is not strictly enforced. The operating system or scheduler may consider the affinity recommendation, but it has the flexibility to schedule the process or thread on a different processor if necessary, based on system load balancing or other factors.

Hard affinity: Hard affinity, on the other hand, enforces a strict binding between a process or thread and a specific processor. The operating system or scheduler must ensure that the process or thread always executes on the designated processor. This binding can be useful in scenarios where strict control over processor allocation is required, such as in real-time systems or when specific performance optimizations are needed.

The choice between soft affinity and hard affinity depends on the specific requirements of the application or system. Soft affinity provides more flexibility for load balancing and resource utilization, while hard affinity guarantees consistent processor allocation but may limit the system's ability to adapt to changing conditions.





User
what is stall in main memory
ChatGPT

In the context of main memory (also known as RAM), a stall refers to a delay or pause in the memory access process that occurs when the processor is waiting for data or instructions to be fetched from or written to the main memory.

Stalls in main memory can happen due to several reasons:

Memory Latency: Main memory typically has higher latency compared to the processor's cache memory. When the processor needs to access data or instructions that are not available in the cache, it needs to fetch them from the main memory, causing a stall while waiting for the data transfer to complete.

Memory Access Conflicts: In multiprocessor systems or systems with shared memory, stalls can occur when multiple processors or threads compete for access to the same memory location. Contentions and conflicts can result in stalls as the processors wait for access to the memory location to be granted.

Memory Management Operations: Stalls can also occur during memory management operations, such as page faults or swapping. When a page fault occurs, indicating that the required data is not currently in the main memory and needs to be fetched from secondary storage, the processor may experience a stall while waiting for the data transfer to complete.

Reducing stalls in main memory is crucial for optimizing overall system performance. Techniques such as caching, prefetching, and optimizing memory access patterns can help mitigate stalls and minimize the impact of memory latency on the processor's execution.





User
what is Static linking and dynamic linking
ChatGPT

Static linking and dynamic linking are two methods of combining software modules or libraries with an executable program. These methods determine how the program interacts with external libraries or dependencies.

Static Linking:
Static linking involves incorporating the code and dependencies of external libraries into the executable at the compilation stage. During static linking, the necessary library functions and code are copied into the final executable. This means that the executable becomes self-contained and does not require any external libraries to be present during runtime. All the required code is bundled together, resulting in a larger executable file size. However, it provides better portability since the executable can be run on different systems without worrying about the availability or compatibility of external libraries.

Dynamic Linking:
Dynamic linking, also known as shared linking or runtime linking, involves referencing external libraries or dependencies at runtime rather than including them in the executable file. During dynamic linking, the program only includes references or links to the required libraries, and the actual library code is loaded and linked at runtime by the operating system or dynamic linker. This allows multiple programs to share a single copy of a library, reducing redundancy and resulting in smaller executable sizes. Dynamic linking also enables easier updates and maintenance of shared libraries since changes in the library can be reflected across multiple programs without recompiling them.

The choice between static linking and dynamic linking depends on various factors, including the size of the executable, portability requirements, flexibility in library updates, and performance considerations. Static linking provides a self-contained executable but can result in larger file sizes, while dynamic linking allows for smaller executables and easier library updates but requires the presence of compatible libraries during runtime.





User
what is  double buffering in mmu
ChatGPT

Double buffering in the context of Memory Management Units (MMUs) typically refers to a technique used to minimize the impact of page table updates on system performance.

In an MMU, the page table is a data structure that maps virtual addresses to physical addresses. When a process or thread switches, the MMU needs to update the page table to reflect the new mapping for the incoming process. This update process can introduce overhead and stall the execution of the processor.

Double buffering helps mitigate this overhead by using two sets of page tables: one set for the currently active process and another set for the incoming process. When a process switch occurs, the MMU can update the incoming process's page table in the background without stalling the processor. Once the update is complete, the MMU can quickly switch to the new set of page tables, avoiding delays caused by updating the page table during context switches.

The active page tables are used for memory accesses during the execution of the current process, while the incoming page tables are being updated in the background. This approach allows for smoother and more efficient process switching without significantly impacting the system's performance.

By employing double buffering, MMUs can reduce the time spent on page table updates, resulting in faster context switches and improved overall system responsiveness. It is an optimization technique commonly used in modern operating systems to enhance memory management efficiency.





User
what is Page Fault
ChatGPT

A page fault is an exception or interrupt that occurs when a process or program attempts to access a page of memory that is currently not mapped or not available in physical memory. It indicates that the requested data or instruction is not present in the main memory and needs to be brought in from secondary storage (such as a hard disk) into the main memory.

When a page fault occurs, the operating system steps in to handle it by performing the following steps:

The operating system identifies the virtual memory address that caused the page fault.

It checks if the required page is present in the main memory. If the page is not in the main memory (i.e., not present in the page table), it is considered a "hard" page fault. If the page is present but marked as invalid or not accessible, it is considered a "soft" page fault.

In the case of a hard page fault, the operating system triggers a process known as "page replacement." It selects a page from the main memory to be evicted or swapped out to secondary storage, making space for the required page to be brought in.

The operating system then initiates the process of loading the requested page from secondary storage into the main memory. This may involve reading the data from disk, allocating a physical page frame, updating the page table, and marking the page as valid.

Once the page is successfully brought into the main memory, the process that encountered the page fault is resumed, and the instruction that caused the page fault is re-executed.

Page faults are an essential mechanism in virtual memory systems, allowing processes to access a larger address space than what is physically available in the main memory. They enable efficient memory management by dynamically loading and unloading pages as needed, while still providing the illusion of a large, contiguous memory space to processes.

give a short and easy example of EAT
ChatGPT

Sure! EAT stands for Estimated Arrival Time, and it is commonly used in transportation or delivery services to estimate when a particular vehicle or shipment will arrive at its destination. Here's a simple example to illustrate EAT:

Let's say you order a pizza for delivery. After placing the order, the pizza restaurant informs you that the EAT is 30 minutes. This means that based on their estimation and previous experience, they expect the delivery person to arrive at your location within approximately 30 minutes.

As time passes, you can track the progress of your pizza's delivery. If 20 minutes have elapsed since you placed the order, you can expect that the pizza will arrive in approximately 10 minutes, adhering to the estimated arrival time of 30 minutes.

Keep in mind that the EAT is an estimation and may vary based on various factors such as traffic conditions, weather, or unforeseen delays. It serves as a guideline to provide an approximate timeframe for when you can expect your delivery to arrive.





User

also solve with showing steps
ChatGPT

Certainly! Here's a simple example of Estimated Arrival Time (EAT) for a road trip:

Let's say you're planning a road trip from City A to City B, which is approximately 200 miles away. Based on your previous experience and considering traffic conditions, you estimate that your average driving speed will be around 50 miles per hour (mph).

To calculate the Estimated Arrival Time (EAT), you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the distance to be covered.
Distance from City A to City B: 200 miles.

Step 2: Estimate your driving speed.
Estimated driving speed: 50 mph.

Step 3: Calculate the Estimated Travel Time.
Estimated Travel Time = Distance / Speed.
Estimated Travel Time = 200 miles / 50 mph = 4 hours.

Step 4: Consider any additional factors.
You may need to factor in rest breaks, traffic congestion, or unexpected delays that can affect your overall travel time.

Step 5: Calculate the Estimated Arrival Time.
If you plan to start your journey at 1:00 PM, you can add the Estimated Travel Time to determine your Estimated Arrival Time.
Estimated Arrival Time = Starting Time + Estimated Travel Time.
Estimated Arrival Time = 1:00 PM + 4 hours = 5:00 PM.

Based on this estimation, you can expect to arrive at City B around 5:00 PM, assuming your driving speed remains constant and no significant delays occur.

Remember, the Estimated Arrival Time is an approximation, and real-time factors like traffic conditions or unexpected events can affect the actual arrival time. It's always a good idea to allow some flexibility and adjust your plans accordingly.





User
formula of EAT in OS and example
ChatGPT

In the context of operating systems, the Estimated Arrival Time (EAT) is often used in scheduling algorithms to estimate the time at which a process or task will complete execution. The formula for calculating EAT varies depending on the scheduling algorithm being used.

One common scheduling algorithm is Round Robin (RR), which allocates a fixed time slice (also known as a quantum) to each process in a cyclic manner. The EAT for a process in Round Robin scheduling can be calculated using the following formula:

EAT = Current Time + Remaining Time

Here's an example to illustrate the calculation of EAT using the Round Robin scheduling algorithm:

Consider three processes P1, P2, and P3 with their respective burst times (time required for execution) as follows:
P1: Burst time = 5
P2: Burst time = 3
P3: Burst time = 7

Assuming a time quantum of 2, let's calculate the EAT for each process:

Start with P1:
Current Time = 0
Remaining Time = 5 (initial burst time)
EAT = 0 + 2 = 2 (As the time quantum is 2)
Proceed to P2:
Current Time = 2
Remaining Time = 1 (as P1 used 1 time quantum)
EAT = 2 + 1 = 3
Move to P3:
Current Time = 3
Remaining Time = 7 (initial burst time)
EAT = 3 + 2 = 5
Continue with P1:
Current Time = 5
Remaining Time = 3 (as P1 used 2 time quanta)
EAT = 5 + 2 = 7
Move to P2:
Current Time = 7
Remaining Time = 0 (P2 completed execution)
EAT = 7 (as no additional time is required)
Finally, finish with P3:
Current Time = 7
Remaining Time = 5 (as P3 used 2 time quanta)
EAT = 7 + 2 = 9
So, the Estimated Arrival Times for the processes in this example using Round Robin scheduling are:
P1: EAT = 7
P2: EAT = 7
P3: EAT = 9

These EAT values represent the estimated times at which each process will complete execution based on the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.
